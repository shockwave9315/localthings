    Explicit exists_fn takes priority. Otherwise, if the entity has a
    field, require that field to be present in the resource rep so that
    optional fields on shared resources don't create phantom entities.

    A stub rep (is_stub_rep) is included anyway so it can be populated by
    sub-polls. A genuinely empty {} rep is included too by this default
    gate: whether empty means "not populated yet" or "permanently
    unsupported" needs per-field domain knowledge this generic gate
    doesn't have (e.g. /alarms/vs/0's {} is fridge.py's documented normal
    no-alarm state, not an absence signal). Only a capability whose author
    has verified a field is genuinely never populated opts into stricter
    gating with its own exists_fn (see common.ENERGY_METER, issue #127).

    A previously registered total_increasing sensor gets one narrow
    continuity exception: if its resource still returns a non-empty rep,
    temporary loss of the cumulative field does not revoke the already
    proven capability. This covers Samsung laundry boards that intermittently
    omit cumulativePower while off without weakening the confirmed-empty
    resource guard above.

    `bound.href` is already the actual href (issue #177); `exists_fn` gets
    `bound`'s own subdevice's canonical view instead of the raw snapshot,
    same rule as everywhere else a whole-resources-dict scan happens --
    this is a free function, so it can't use self._resources.

    Reads `discovery_resources`, not `last_resources`: on an offline load
    (issue #295) the live cache is still empty, and judging existence
    against it would filter every rehydrated entity away.
