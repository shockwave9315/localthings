        A downloaded program is only usable once the appliance has been seen
        sitting on it (that is the only time its replay payload is visible)
        and the user has given it a name. The device advertises how many it
        has, so the gap between that and what's usable is knowable -- and
        it can only be closed by the user walking the appliance through its
        own Download list, which is exactly what a Repair is for.

        Gated on having seen at least one payload, which is the only
        available evidence that this household uses downloaded programs at
        all. Without it, an appliance that merely advertises slots -- the
        DW5000C fixture reports four and has never loaded any -- would carry
        a permanent warning about a feature its owner may never touch, and
        nothing they do in Home Assistant could clear it. Running one
        downloaded program is what turns the nudge on, and naming them is
        what turns it off.

        Also gated on cloud_courses_enabled (issue #364): a device can seed a
        slot's payload before the owner has ever meant to use the feature --
        reporters observed one auto-populate from a SmartThings-provided

        intent to use it. Checked here rather than skipping
        _observe_cloud_courses' recording, so turning the option back on
        re-evaluates against everything already learned instead of only
        what arrives afterward.

        Also a no-op with an empty cloud_course_rep (issue #364): this now
        runs from __init__.py's options-update listener on every entry
        save, including an unrelated one (CONF_BYPASS_REMOTE_CONTROL, say)
        made before this device's first poll or while it's rehydrated
        offline. /course/vs/0 unpolled reads as no advertised slots, which
        would otherwise delete a Repair a real poll had every reason to
        raise, on evidence that only means "haven't asked the device yet."
        Leaves whatever issue state already exists untouched rather than
        guess either way; the next real poll re-evaluates for real.
