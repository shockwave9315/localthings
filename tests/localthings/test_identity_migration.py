"""Moving an existing install onto the OCF device UUID (issue #381).

This migration can't finish inside `async_migrate_entry` -- the UUID is
only readable from the appliance, and an entry can load from its snapshot
while that appliance is off (issue #295) -- so the coordinator adopts it
on the first live poll, rewriting both registries and the entry's
unique_id together.

That makes it the riskiest migration here: it rewrites the identity of
rows a user's automations, history and areas hang off. These tests are
organised around what must not break rather than around the functions
involved. Statistics are covered separately, against a real recorder, in
tests/test_rekey_statistics_end_to_end.py.
