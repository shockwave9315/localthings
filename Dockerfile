# Home Assistant normally installs a custom integration's manifest.json
# requirements itself at integration setup, but that depends on the
# container having outbound network access at exactly that moment and
# repeats the install attempt on every container recreate. Baking
# smartthings-local into the image keeps the dev container usable
# offline and avoids relying on that runtime install path.
